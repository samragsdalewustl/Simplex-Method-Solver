<b>Simplex Method Solver: </b>
<br /> <br />
A quick and dirty python simplex method solver. It needs a lot of work, but for now it takes an objective function and a set of constraints in augmented form and returns a result.
<br /><br />
To come: <br />
-Converts all problems to augmented form <br />
-Detects infeasible and unbounded problems <br />
-Solves the dual problem in parallel <br />
-Provides feasiblity analysis after completion <br />
