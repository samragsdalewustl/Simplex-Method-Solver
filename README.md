Simplex Method Solver:

A quick and dirty python simplex method solver. It needs a lot of work, but for now it takes an objective function and a set of constraints in augmented form and returns a result.
\n\n
To come:
-Converts all problems to augmented form \n
-Detects infeasible and unbounded problems \n
-Solves the dual problem in parallel\n
-Provides feasiblity analysis after completion\n
