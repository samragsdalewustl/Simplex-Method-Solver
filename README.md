Simplex Method Solver:

A quick and dirty python simplex method solver. It needs a lot of work, but for now it takes an objective function and a set of constraints in augmented form and returns a result.

To come:
-Converts all problems to augmented form
-Detects infeasible and unbounded problems
-Solves the dual problem in parallel
-Provides feasiblity analysis after completion
